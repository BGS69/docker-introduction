The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\r\n    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\r\n 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\r\n    to your terminal.\r\n\r\nTo try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:\r\n $ docker run -it ubuntu bash\r\n\r\nShare images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:\r\n https://cloud.docker.com/\r\n\r\nFor more examples and ideas, visit:\r\n https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/\r\n\r\n"
